**Episode 1: Rainy Days and New Beginnings**

New Delhi in June was a pressure cooker, the kind that made you curse the sun and pray for a breeze that never came. But today, the sky had cracked open like a mischievous god had tipped over a bucket of water, and the city was drenched in a glorious, unseasonal downpour. Lodi Garden, usually a dusty sprawl of joggers and selfie-stick warriors, had turned into a glistening emerald, its lawns slick, its ancient tombs softened by the rain.

Meena Sharma, 32 and perpetually late for life’s big moments, stood under a gulmohar tree, her yellow kurta plastered to her skin. She’d come to the park on a whim, lured by the rare rumble of thunder while sipping her morning chai. Her sneakers squelched in the mud, and her hair, usually a sleek ponytail, was now a frizzy rebellion. But Meena didn’t care. Rain in Delhi was like finding a ten-rupee note in an old jeans pocket—rare, thrilling, and worth celebrating.

“Arrey, this is better than any Spotify monsoon playlist,” she muttered, tilting her face to the sky. Droplets slid down her cheeks, and she grinned, feeling like a kid who’d just bunked school. Work could wait. Her boss’s emails, with their passive-aggressive “kindly revert” nonsense, could drown in this rain for all she cared. Meena was a graphic designer, freelancing for startups that thought “exposure” was a personality trait. Today, though, she was just a girl in love with the weather.

Across the soggy lawn, under the dubious shelter of a crumbling Mughal arch, stood Mathur Krishnan, 43, looking like a man who’d lost a bet with the universe. His linen shirt was a soggy disaster, and his glasses were fogged up, giving him the air of a disgruntled owl. Mathur, a history professor with a penchant for overanalyzing everything, had come to Lodi Garden to escape the existential dread of grading papers. The rain, he’d thought, would be poetic—Tagore vibes, maybe, or at least a good Instagram caption. Instead, he was wet, mildly irritated, and wondering why he hadn’t stayed home with his dog and a glass of Old Monk.

“Poetry, my foot,” he grumbled, wiping his glasses on his shirt, which only smeared the lenses further. He squinted at the park, now a blur of green and gray, and spotted a figure twirling under a tree like some Bollywood heroine. “Who does that in real life?” he muttered, equal parts annoyed and intrigued.

Meena, oblivious to her audience, was now attempting a half-hearted pirouette, her arms outstretched. The rain was slowing to a drizzle, but the magic hadn’t faded. She hummed a tune—something from *Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge*, naturally—and didn’t notice the puddle until her foot sank into it with a spectacular *splat*. She yelped, flailed, and grabbed the gulmohar’s trunk to avoid a full-on faceplant.

Mathur, despite himself, chuckled. The sound carried across the lawn, and Meena’s head snapped up. Her eyes, sharp and curious, locked onto the soggy professor under the arch. “Oi, laughing at my near-death experience?” she called, brushing wet hair from her face. Her voice was all Delhi—brash, teasing, with a hint of warmth that made you want to argue back.

Mathur raised his hands in mock surrender. “Near-death? That was barelylieutenant. “Hardly a tragedy. You tripped. It happens.”

Meena snorted, undeterred. “Oh, please. You’re just jealous because I’m embracing the moment and you’re hiding like a scaredy-cat.” She took a step closer, her sneakers making squishy noises. The rain had picked up again, a soft patter, and the air smelled of wet earth and possibility.

Mathur adjusted his glasses, suddenly aware of how ridiculous he must look. “Embracing the moment? You’re one puddle away from needing a lifeguard.”

She laughed, a sound that cut through the drizzle like sunlight. “And you’re one frown away from turning into my old school principal. Lighten up, uncle!”

“Uncle?” Mathur’s eyebrows shot up. He stepped out from under the arch, rain be damned. “I’ll have you know I’m in my prime. Practically Ranbir Kapoor’s stunt double.”

Meena doubled over, clutching her stomach. “Ranbir? Try Rishi Kapoor in his *Chandni* days, maybe.” She grinned, and Mathur felt something loosen in his chest, like a knot he hadn’t known was there.

They were closer now, standing on the wet grass, the park empty except for a stray dog shaking itself dry near a banyan tree. Meena tilted her head, sizing him up. He was tall, with salt-and-pepper hair and a jawline that could still turn heads, even if his vibe screamed “I read Proust for fun.” She liked that. Too many men her age were either gym-obsessed or still living in their mom’s basement.

“I’m Meena,” she said, sticking out a damp hand. “Puddle enthusiast.”

“Mathur,” he replied, shaking her hand. Her grip was firm, her fingers cold from the rain. “Professional grump, apparently.”

Their hands lingered a beat too long, and Meena’s stomach did a little flip. *Oh, no you don’t,* she told her traitorous heart. She wasn’t here for a meet-cute. She was here for the rain, the freedom, the—

“Want to walk?” Mathur asked, surprising himself. He wasn’t the spontaneous type. His life was lectures, deadlines, and the occasional existential crisis over whether history was just one big rerun. But something about this woman, with her soggy kurta and fearless grin, made him want to keep talking.

Meena hesitated, then shrugged. “Sure, why not? But if I slip again, you’re carrying me home.”

“Deal,” he said, and they started down the path, the gravel crunching underfoot. The rain was a fine mist now, cloaking the park in a dreamy haze. Bougainvillea spilled over stone walls, and the air hummed with the chirp of drenched sparrows.

They talked as they walked, words tumbling out like the rain itself. Meena told him about her latest client, a startup selling artisanal pickles (“They want a logo that screams ‘grandma’s recipe’ but also ‘buy me, I’m hip’”). Mathur shared his theory that Delhi’s traffic was a metaphor for human existence (“Chaotic, pointless, and everyone’s honking”). She laughed at his dry humor; he marveled at her energy, like she could power Connaught Place with her smile.

At one point, they stopped by a lotus pond, the water rippling under the drizzle. Meena pointed at a frog perched on a leaf. “Look! He’s judging us.”

Mathur peered over his glasses. “He’s probably wondering why two grown adults are acting like monsoon-crazed teenagers.”

“Pfft. Teenagers wish they had our vibes.” Meena nudged his arm, and the touch sent a jolt through him. He glanced at her—really looked—and saw the way her eyes crinkled, the way her wet kurta clung to her curves. *Stop it, Krishnan,* he thought. *You’re too old for this.*

But Meena was looking at him too, her gaze lingering on the way his shirt stuck to his shoulders, the way his voice softened when he talked about his dog, a mutt named Tolstoy. There was something solid about him, like he’d seen the world’s mess and still showed up every day. She liked that too.

The rain stopped as suddenly as it started, leaving the park sparkling under a shy sun. They reached the park’s exit, where an auto-rickshaw driver was blasting Honey Singh at full volume. Meena turned to Mathur, her heart doing that flip thing again.

“So, Professor Grump,” she said, hands on her hips. “Same time tomorrow? In case it rains again?”

Mathur’s lips twitched. He should say no. He had papers to grade, a lecture to prep, a life to overthink. But instead, he said, “Only if you promise not to call me uncle.”

She laughed, her eyes dancing. “No promises, Rishi Kapoor.”

As she waved and disappeared into the auto-rickshaw’s neon-green chaos, Mathur stood there, raindrops drying on his glasses. For the first time in ages, he didn’t feel like analyzing anything. He just felt… alive.

**Episode 2: Dinner and Desire**

The next day, Lodi Garden was a furnace, the sun back to its tyrant ways, no hint of yesterday’s rain. Meena stood by the gulmohar tree, her heart doing a nervous bhangra. She’d swapped her kurta for a red blouse and jeans, hoping it said “effortless” and not “I spent an hour panicking in front of my mirror.” Would Mathur show? Or was yesterday just a fluke, a monsoon-induced fever dream? She checked her phone—5:58 p.m. Two minutes to their agreed time. Her stomach churned. *He’s not coming,* she thought, kicking a pebble. *I’m an idiot.*

Across the park, Mathur loitered near the Mughal arch, his linen kurta crisp but his nerves in tatters. He’d barely slept, replaying their banter, her laugh, the way her wet kurta had hugged her curves. *She won’t come,* he told himself, adjusting his glasses. *She’s young, vibrant. Why would she waste time on a grumpy old historian?* He glanced at his watch—5:59 p.m.—and considered bolting to avoid the embarrassment of being stood up.

Then he saw her, red blouse glowing like a flame under the gulmohar. Meena spotted him too, and her face split into a grin that made his chest ache. “Professor Grump!” she called, striding over. “You showed. I was sure you’d chicken out.”

Mathur’s lips twitched. “And miss round two of your puddle acrobatics? Never.” Relief flooded him, warm and heady. She was here. She was *real*.

They fell into step, the park alive with evening joggers and ice-cream vendors. The banter flowed—her teasing him about his “uncle vibes,” him retorting that her energy could power a Delhi metro. But under it, nerves buzzed. Meena’s hands fidgeted; Mathur’s voice was a shade too careful. When she suggested dinner, half-expecting him to dodge, he said, “There’s a place in Hauz Khas. Good kebabs, better wine. You in?”

She was. Very in.

---

Hauz Khas Village was a maze of fairy lights and hipster vibes, and the restaurant, tucked into a narrow lane, was all candlelit coziness—low tables, Urdu ghazals humming softly, the air thick with the scent of galouti kebabs. Meena and Mathur sat across from each other, a bottle of Sula red between them, and the date felt like a tightrope walk between electric and awkward.

“You clean up nice,” Meena said, sipping her wine. He did—kurta rolled at the sleeves, stubble just right, eyes warm behind his glasses. Her pulse raced, and she cursed her body for betraying her cool-girl facade.

“You’re not bad yourself,” Mathur replied, his gaze lingering on her lips. “Though I half-expected you to show up in soggy sneakers.”

She laughed, and the tension eased. They talked about Delhi’s quirks (her love for Old Delhi chaat, his for quiet bookshops), their worst dates (her: a guy who mansplained biryani; him: a woman who live-tweeted their coffee). But when Meena, emboldened by wine, asked about his past relationships, Mathur’s smile faltered.

“Oh, you know,” he said, swirling his glass. “Ancient history. Not worth digging up.” His tone was light, but his eyes were guarded, like a door slammed shut.

Meena frowned, sensing a wall. “Come on, not even a juicy ex story? You’re 43, not a monk.” She meant it playfully, but his jaw tightened.

“Let’s just say I’m better at grading papers than keeping girlfriends,” he said, forcing a chuckle. “Your turn. Spill.”

She let it slide, though it stung. She talked about her last breakup—a startup bro who’d called her “too much”—but her mind was on Mathur’s evasion. Still, the wine, the kebabs, his low laugh when she mimicked her boss’s accent—it was hard to stay mad. By dessert (gulkand ice cream, divine), their knees were brushing under the table, and every touch felt like a spark.

“Walk you home?” he asked as they stepped into the humid night. Hauz Khas glittered, autos honking in the distance.

“My place is close,” she said, heart pounding. “You could… come up. For coffee.” Her eyes held his, bold and nervous all at once.

Mathur’s throat tightened. “Coffee sounds good,” he said, voice low.

---

Meena’s apartment was a fifth-floor walk-up in a noisy Green Park lane, all mismatched cushions and fairy lights. She fumbled with the keys, hyper-aware of Mathur behind her, his scent—sandalwood and rain—making her dizzy. Inside, she didn’t bother with coffee. Neither did he.

“Meena,” he said, stepping closer, his voice rough. “If you want me to go—”

She cut him off, grabbing his kurta and pulling him into a kiss. It was hungry, urgent, months of pent-up want crashing together. His glasses bumped her nose; she laughed into his mouth, and he grinned, yanking them off. His hands gripped her waist, pulling her against him, her breasts pressing into his chest as their tongues tangled.

They stumbled to her bedroom, clothes coming off in a frenzy—her blouse unbuttoned, his kurta yanked over his head, her jeans shucked to the floor, his belt clattering. Meena’s bra hit the rug, and Mathur’s boxers followed. Naked, they paused, breathing hard, eyes raking over each other. Her skin was flushed, nipples hard; his cock was already stiff, straining toward her.

He pushed her onto the bed, the mattress creaking under their weight. His mouth was on her neck, sucking hard enough to leave marks, then lower, licking and biting her nipples until she moaned, her fingers digging into his shoulders. “Mathur,” she gasped, and he growled, sliding a hand between her thighs. She was wet, slick under his fingers as he stroked her clit, circling until her hips bucked.

“Fuck, Meena,” he muttered, voice thick. She grabbed his wrist, guiding his fingers inside her, two at first, then three, pumping slow and deep. Her moans grew louder, unfiltered, as she rode his hand, her walls clenching around him.

She tugged him up, kissing him hard, tasting herself on his lips. “Now,” she said, voice raw, and he nodded, eyes dark with need. He spread her thighs wide, hooking her legs over his shoulders. His cock nudged her entrance, and she arched, urging him on. He thrust in, hard and deep, filling her in one stroke. She cried out, the stretch intense but so fucking good.

They moved together, frantic, the bedframe rattling. His thrusts were relentless, cock slamming into her, hitting spots that made her see stars. Her nails raked his back, leaving red trails; his hands gripped her hips, bruising as he fucked her harder. “Meena,” he groaned, her name a prayer, and she clenched around him, her orgasm building fast.

“Harder,” she begged, and he obliged, pounding into her, sweat slicking their bodies. The fan spun uselessly above, the room a furnace of heat and sex. She came first, a shuddering scream as her pussy pulsed around him, milking his cock. He followed seconds later, thrusting deep as he spilled inside her, a guttural moan tearing from his throat.

They collapsed, panting, her head on his chest, his cock softening inside her. His fingers traced her arm, lazy now, as their breathing slowed. The city hummed outside—autos, dogs, life—but here, it was just them, sweaty and spent.

“Coffee’s overrated,” Meena murmured, smirking.

Mathur laughed, soft and warm. “Agreed.”

But as she drifted off, his arm around her, Meena couldn’t shake the niggle in her gut. That wall he’d put up at dinner, the past he wouldn’t share—it lingered, a shadow in their glow. For now, though, she let it go, lulled by his heartbeat and the Delhi night.
