    Episode 1: A Dance of Duty
    Elizabeth’s fingers trembled as she pinned a final curl into Lady Violetta’s chestnut tresses, the candlelight casting shadows across the rose-papered boudoir. The Sisley townhouse hummed with the urgency of the London Season’s opening ball, and downstairs, the carriage waited to whisk them into the ton’s glittering whirl. At three-and-twenty, Elizabeth moved with practiced grace, her grey muslin dress—starched to crispness through her own late-night efforts—whispering against the polished floor. Her heart raced, not for herself, but for Violetta, whose hazel eyes were fixed on the dog-eared copy of Persuasion lying forlornly on the bedside table.
    “Elizabeth, must I go?” Violetta’s voice quavered, her slender frame swathed in a lavender gown that shimmered like moonlight on water. At nineteen, the heiress to the Duchy of Sisley clutched her fan, its ribbon twisted in nervous fingers. “I’d rather stay with Miss Austen than face a ballroom full of strangers.”
    Elizabeth’s lips curved, a flicker of warmth cutting through her nerves. She’d served Violetta since they were girls, their bond woven from shared secrets and quiet laughter. “My lady, you know the Season waits for no one, not even a bookish heiress,” she said, securing a pearl comb in Violetta’s hair. “Your aunt’s like a general plotting a campaign, and I’ll not let you face the ton unprepared. You’ll be the evening’s brightest star.”
    Violetta’s smile was faint, her gaze distant. “They’ll see my title, not me. I’m no match for their expectations.”
    “You’re cleverer than most, and kinder,” Elizabeth replied, her tone soft but firm. She adjusted Violetta’s sash, her calloused fingers brushing the fine muslin, a fabric she’d never wear. The thought stirred a quiet ache, quickly buried beneath her duty. “Any gentleman who misses that isn’t worth your notice.” Her blue eyes met Violetta’s in the mirror, steady despite the whirl of her own thoughts—thoughts of a life spent serving, of dreams tucked away like the coins she hoarded for an uncertain future.
    The gown flattered Violetta’s lithe form, its silver embroidery catching the light. A sapphire pendant, a Sisley heirloom, gleamed at her throat, a silent reminder of the legacy Elizabeth could only tend. She stepped back, her own reflection a shadow in her patched apron, her pride holding her upright in a world that offered her little.
    Downstairs, Lady Augusta, Violetta’s aunt, swept into the hall, her burgundy silk rustling with purpose. Her grey eyes softened at Violetta’s appearance. “My dear, you’re enchanting,” she said, though her voice held an edge of haste. As Violetta lingered by the door, her fan a shield, Augusta drew Elizabeth aside.
    “Elizabeth,” she murmured, her tone low, “Sisley’s future rests on Violetta. She must wed a man of higher rank and bear a child to secure the Duchy, else it falls to a wastrel cousin who’d ruin it.” Her gaze sharpened. “Few unwed peers outrank her, but tonight, the Duke of Lancaster, Cheltenham, attends. He’s titled, eligible, and charming, by all accounts. You must ensure Violetta catches his eye.”
    Elizabeth’s pulse quickened, but she nodded, her expression composed. “I’ll do my utmost, my lady.” The task settled like a weight, familiar yet heavy, as if she were balancing a tray of crystal while the ton danced around her.
    The ballroom at Almack’s was a dazzling blur, chandeliers casting prisms across gilded walls as couples swirled to a quadrille’s lively strains. Elizabeth hovered behind Violetta, her eyes scanning the crowd while her hands smoothed her apron, a reflex from years of making do. The laughter and clink of glasses surrounded her, a world of ease she could only observe. Her gaze lingered on a lady’s emerald necklace, its sparkle a fleeting reminder of what she’d never possess, but she pushed the thought aside, focusing on Violetta’s trembling form.
    Augusta guided Violetta forward, her voice bright. “Your Grace, may I present my niece, Lady Violetta, heiress to the Duchy of Sisley?”
    Duke Cheltenham, Duke of Lancaster, turned, and Elizabeth’s breath caught. At two-and-thirty, he was tall, his dark hair swept back from a face both striking and warm. His green eyes held a spark of amusement, as if he saw through the ton’s pageantry. His claret coat was impeccably tailored, its richness a quiet rebuke to Elizabeth’s threadbare hem. He bowed, his gaze settling on Violetta with polite curiosity. “A pleasure, Lady Violetta. Are you enjoying the Season’s revelry?”
    Violetta’s cheeks flushed, her voice barely audible. “I… prefer books to balls, Your Grace.”
    Elizabeth tensed, ready to nudge the conversation, but Cheltenham’s lips twitched upward. “A wise preference. I’ve lost many an evening to Mr. Scott’s novels when I should’ve been dancing.”
    Violetta’s eyes brightened, a spark of interest piercing her shyness. “You read Scott? Which is your favorite?”
    “Waverley,” he said, his tone easy. “Though I wager you favor Miss Austen?”
    Elizabeth exhaled, relief mingling with a reluctant admiration for the Duke’s charm. Augusta’s sharp glance kept her vigilant, but Violetta was already speaking of Pride and Prejudice, her voice gaining warmth. When the orchestra struck up a waltz, Cheltenham extended his hand. “May I have this dance, Lady Violetta?”
    Violetta hesitated, glancing at Elizabeth, who gave a subtle nod. “You’ll shine, my lady,” she whispered, her voice steady despite the flutter in her chest. She watched them glide onto the floor, Violetta’s lavender skirts swirling against Cheltenham’s elegance. They moved with unexpected ease, a picture of harmony that stirred hope in Elizabeth’s heart.
    But as the dance ended, Violetta’s confidence wavered, and she murmured an excuse about needing air. Elizabeth followed her to the terrace, her worn shoes silent on the stone. “Are you well, my lady?” she asked, finding Violetta leaning against the balustrade, her face pale in the moonlight.
    “He’s kind,” Violetta said softly, “but I feel like a fraud. What if I fail Sisley, Elizabeth?”
    “You won’t,” Elizabeth said, taking Violetta’s hands. Her own were rough from years of work, a contrast she barely noticed in her fierce loyalty. “You’re stronger than you know, and I’m here, always.” The words were true, yet a quiet undercurrent stirred in her— a sense of standing on the edge of a world she could never enter, serving a future not her own.
    Returning to the ballroom, Elizabeth caught Cheltenham’s gaze across the room. He was speaking with another gentleman, but his eyes flicked toward Violetta, thoughtful. For a fleeting moment, they met Elizabeth’s, and a warmth sparked within her, swiftly tamped down. He was Violetta’s hope, not hers. Yet his easy smile lingered, a whisper of something she couldn’t afford to name.
    Augusta appeared beside her, her voice a murmur. “Well done, Elizabeth. Keep her steady, and we may secure Sisley yet.”
    Elizabeth nodded, her thoughts straying to the Duke, to the life beyond her reach. The Season stretched ahead, a dance of duty and unspoken longing, and she would play her part, even as her heart hummed with possibilities she could never claim.
